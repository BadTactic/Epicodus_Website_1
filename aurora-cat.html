    <h1>Aurora The Cat</h1>
    <h3><em>A brief description of Aurora of "Ma-ma's" the Cat</em></h3>
    <p> Aurora is a white cat that went through a lot of trauma as a kitten but we take extremely good care of her.
She lives a pampered life and goes on many adventures.
    </p>
  <h4>Here is a list of her adventures.</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Sleeping by the wood stove.</li>
    <li>Sleeping on the human's pillows.</li>
    <li>Chasing fake mice from 1am to 4am. Loudly. </li>
    <li>Complaining at 5am for food, loudly.</li>
  </ol>
